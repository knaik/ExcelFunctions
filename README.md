This was my implementation of the classic half life
formula to find final concentration and initial concentration.

uses current date so when downloaded, the metabolite levels present are accurate.

excel is hard to update from a phone, that's the next idea. push data into this excel file from a simple phone.

Chemically assumes first order reaction rate and published half life of 3.5 hours for primary drug and 8 hours for active metabolite.

This can be adapted to caffeine intake with a differently calculated half life.
